# Rules of Checkers 

Checkers, also known as English Draughts, is a two-player board game played on an 8x8 checkered board. Here are the basic rules:

## Objective

The main objective of checkers is to capture all of the opponent's pieces or to block them so they cannot make a move. If a player cannot make a move, they lose.

## Setup

- Each player begins with 12 pieces (men).
- The pieces are placed on the dark squares of the three rows closest to each player.

## Moves

- Men (the pieces originally on the board) move diagonally forward to an adjacent unoccupied dark square.
- If a man reaches the last row on the opponent's side of the board, it is "kinged" and can move diagonally forward or backward. 
- White moves first.

## Capturing

- A piece captures an opponent's piece by jumping over it diagonally to an empty square immediately beyond it.
- Multiple jumps are allowed in a single turn if the conditions for capturing are met. Multiple jumps can *only be made with one piece.*
- Capturing is forced. If a player can make a capture, they must do so. If multiple captures are available, the player must chose one of them.
- A player cannot capture once and stop if another capture is immediately available with the same piece. They must finish the capture chain.

## Kings

- When a piece becomes a king (by reaching the opponent's back row), it is marked by stacking an additional piece on top of it in the over-the-board version of the game.
- Kings can move and capture diagonally both forward and backward.

## Winning the Game

- A player wins by capturing all of the opponent's pieces or by blocking them so they cannot move.

## Draws

- The game is declared a draw if neither player can force a win. This is similar to the three-move-repetition rule in chess.
